# URL Shortener API

A simple and fully functional URL shortening API built using Python and Flask.  
It shortens long URLs into compact 6-character codes and supports redirection and analytics.

This was developed as part of the SDE Internship Assignment.

---

##  Tech Stack

- Python 3.8+
- Flask (for API)
- Pytest (for testing)
- In-memory storage using Python dictionaries

---

## Features

- `POST /api/shorten` ‚Äì Generate a short code for any valid long URL
- `GET /<short_code>` ‚Äì Redirects to the original URL
- `GET /api/stats/<short_code>` ‚Äì Returns click count, creation time, and original URL
- In-memory data storage (no DB used)
- Fully tested (6 unit tests)

---

##  Getting Started

cd assignment
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Curl Examples

```bash
# Shorten a URL
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/shorten \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"url": "https://www.example.com/very/long/url"}'

# Redirect to original URL
curl -L http://localhost:5000/abc123

# Get analytics
curl http://localhost:5000/api/stats/abc123


Notes

- The app uses a Python dictionary to store data ‚Äî no database is required.
- Data will reset when the app restarts (due to in-memory storage).
- All short codes are randomly generated and assumed unique.
- Basic URL validation is implemented using regex.
- The project follows clean code and separation of concerns.
